        <p>Hello, I am Muzhda, an Afghan lady who moved to The United States early 2016. I worked as a Senior Coordinator of Monitoring and Evaluation Technical Support Team at Rahman Safi International (RSI). I am an Afghan Citizen with more than eight years of professional working experience in the capacity of monitoring and evaluation with different humanitarian organizations. I supported the initial design, pilot testing, and subsequent implementation of the M&E system for various projects. My support included working with the client’s M&E team to review and tailor the Performance Management Plan (PMP), and activities of the project to RSI’s innovative technology based M&E solution. I also served as a primary focal point between the client’s M&E team, and RSI’s application development team. I was also integral to the independent third party monitoring of USAID’s funded projects, where I reviewed field monitoring reports, findings, and recommendations by field teams to project management and USAID.

        Before my work with the RSI, I worked as a Monitoring and Evaluation Manager and then as Data Quality Assurance Manager with a number of USAID funded projects, including USAID’s Stablity in Key Areas (SIKA-E), implemented by Architecture Engineering Consulting Operation and Maintenance (AECOM) in Afghanistan.  I conducted more than a dozen of Data Quality Assessments (DQAs) using ADS 203 standards. In addition, I remained a key team member in designing the Monitoring and Evaluation System for many USAID projects. I am energetic with significant writing abilities to accurately convey the message to the readers. I  am bilingual with translation skills from English to Persian  and can work with a diverse ethnic field teams.</p>
